# Project4_Group9


## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the containment date of wildfires in California. Accurate predictions of containment dates can help improve response times and allocate resources more effectively, ultimately reducing the impact of wildfires.

### Data Source
 - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/california-fire-perimeters-all-b3436  
Fire Perimeter Dataset: This dataset includes information about the perimeter of fires, including attributes like the year, state, agency, fire name, alarm date, containment date, cause, and GIS-calculated acres.(22000 Data rows)
 - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/california-fire-hazard-severity-zone-viewer-8abb4  
Incident Dataset: This dataset contains details about fire incidents, including incident name, date created, administrative unit, location, acres burned, containment status, latitude, longitude, and more.
