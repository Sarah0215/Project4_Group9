# Project4_Group9


## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the containment time of wildfires in California. Accurate predictions of containment times can help improve response times and allocate resources more effectively, ultimately reducing the impact of wildfires. This project utilizes data from various sources including wildfire incidents, county population statistics, and temperature records.

## Data Preprocessing

### Key Preprocessing Steps

- Merging Datasets: Combined population, wildfire, and temperature data based on relevant keys.
   - Files Used:
      - `california_population_by_county.csv`
      - `map_data_final.csv`
      - `temperature_map_data.csv`
- Date Conversion: Converted incident start and end dates to datetime format and calculated the containment time in hours.
- Feature Engineering: Extracted additional temporal features such as day of year, month, and year from the incident dates.
- Handling Missing Values: Dropped rows with missing values in critical columns to ensure data integrity.

## Model Training
The Random Forest Classifier was chosen for this project due to its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets with multiple features. The model was trained to classify the containment time into three categories: short (less than 24 hours), medium (24 to 72 hours), and long (more than 72 hours).

### Key Features Used

- Acres burned
- County population
- Mean temperature
- Incident latitude and longitude
- Day of year, month, and year of incident creation and extinguishment

## Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using various metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation was also performed to ensure the reliability of the model's performance.

### Performance Metrics
- Overall Accuracy: 75%
- Cross-validated Accuracy: 76% Â± 2%

### Detailed Results
- Short Containment Time: Precision = 0.61, Recall = 0.61, F1-score = 0.61
- Medium Containment Time: Precision = 0.41, Recall = 0.38, F1-score = 0.39
- Long Containment Time: Precision = 0.87, Recall = 0.89, F1-score = 0.88

## Insights and Improvements

The wildfire containment prediction model faces several flaws: class imbalance biases predictions towards long containment times, and the feature set is limited, missing factors like vegetation type and resource availability. The model's complexity could be improved with advanced techniques like gradient boosting. Data quality, especially for weather and air quality, is crucial, as inaccuracies affect predictions. The model also lacks transparency in its decision-making process. Addressing these issues through balanced class weights, expanded features, high-quality data, and methods for transparency like SHAP can enhance its accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion
The project successfully meets the requirement of achieving at least 75% classification accuracy and utilizes data retrieved via Spark. The model provides valuable insights into wildfire containment times, which can aid in better preparedness and resource allocation. Future improvements can further enhance the model's accuracy and reliability, making it an even more powerful tool for wildfire management.

## Ethical Considerations
We strive for fairness by using representative data and evaluating the model to detect and mitigate biases. Transparency is maintained by making predictions interpretable and providing thorough documentation of the model development process. We ensure that the model runs efficiently to minimize resource usage, promoting sustainability. These measures ensure that the model remains accurate and responsible.
